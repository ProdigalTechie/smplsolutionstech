## How can you contribute?
### Current HTML/CSS pages that needs some love:
#### Privacy.cshtml page
##### Details
The privacy page is in desperate need of someone to format the wall of text into a clean HTML page with maybe a splash of CSS. You should be able to work and load this page in your browser without having to build the project.

##### Paths
Privacy.cshtml is located in SmplSolutionsTech/Pages/Home/Privacy.html
privacy.css is located in SmplSolutionsTech/wwwroot/css/privacy.css

##### Questions
